                <div>
                    <p>In the enduring conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, the toll on human lives is staggering, with casualties mounting on both sides. However, it's the Palestinian population that has borne a significant proportion of this grim toll. Among the victims are civilians, including innocent children, who have tragically become collateral damage in the cycle of violence. </p>
                    <p>The years marked by major military operations—such as 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021—have witnessed particularly devastating spikes in casualties. During these periods, widespread military assaults and conflicts have resulted in a sharp escalation of deaths and injuries among Palestinians. The impact of these operations reverberates long after the fighting subsides, leaving behind a trail of shattered lives and communities. </p>
                    <p>The sheer magnitude of over 31,000 lives lost underscores the severity of the situation and the profound human suffering endured by Palestinians. Behind each casualty lies a story of grief, loss, and unimaginable pain for families and loved ones left behind. The conflict's relentless toll not only devastates individual lives but also perpetuates a cycle of trauma and despair across generations. </p>
                    <p>Addressing the root causes of the conflict and working towards a sustainable resolution is essential to prevent further loss of life and alleviate the profound suffering endured by both Palestinians and Israelis. Until meaningful steps are taken towards peace and reconciliation, the tragic cycle of violence is destined to persist, claiming more innocent lives and perpetuating the cycle of suffering for generations to come.</p>

            <section class="infoB"><h2>Damages: Israeli Palestine Conflict</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>In the aftermath of Israeli military operations, Palestinian communities are grappling with widespread destruction across homes, schools, hospitals, and crucial infrastructure. The blockade and restrictions on construction materials have compounded the crisis, hindering efforts to rebuild and develop areas like Gaza. This has left residents facing ongoing challenges in accessing adequate housing and essential public services. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, the conflict has taken a heavy toll on cultural and historical sites, with mosques, churches, archaeological sites, and heritage buildings bearing the brunt of the damage. This threatens the preservation of Palestinian history and identity, raising concerns for future generations. </p>
                    <p>The impact isn't limited to buildings and monuments. Israeli military actions, including bombings and land seizures, have inflicted severe damage on agricultural lands, fisheries, and industrial zones. This has disrupted livelihoods, heightened food insecurity, and exacerbated economic instability throughout Palestinian territories. </p>
                    <p>The destruction and ongoing repercussions underscore the urgent need for attention to the plight of Palestinians affected by the conflict. As communities struggle to recover, there's a pressing call for international support and concerted efforts toward a lasting resolution to address the root causes of the conflict. </p>

            <section class="infoB" > <h2>Economic Impact: Israeli Palestine Conflict</h2>
                <div><p>The conflict has resulted in economic devastation, with widespread unemployment, poverty, and limited economic opportunities for Palestinians. Restrictions on movement, trade, and access to markets have hindered economic development and growth, particularly in Gaza. Many Palestinians, especially those in Gaza, rely heavily on humanitarian aid and assistance for basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. The blockade and economic restrictions have contributed to a cycle of dependency, hindering long-term economic stability and self-sufficiency.</p> </div>
